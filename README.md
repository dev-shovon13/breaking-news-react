# ABC News

This project was made with Material UI

## SAD News

In this Project at first I used "newsapi.org" as API. Though I was able to use the free version of the API locally, unfortunately after deploying my site in Netlify, it gave a ERROR. I came to know that, "newsapi.org" has stopped their Free version in any kind of deploment.

### `GOOD News`
I just copied the data from "newsapi.org" & made my own local JSON file. Now it's working

You can also look at Layout folder for the UI. There are some Photos attached.
Thanks
